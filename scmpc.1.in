.SH NAME
scmpc \- An Audioscrobbler client for MPD
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scmpc
.RB [ " -dhknqv " ]
.RB [ " -f\ <config_file> " ]
.RB [ " -i <pid_file> " ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B scmpc
is a client for MPD (the Music Player Daemon) which submits your tracks to
Audioscrobbler. It can be run as a daemon, which is the default behaviour, or
it can be run in the foreground with the logs directed to standard out.
.PP
.B scmpc
can be run without a connection to the internet as it stores songs in a queue
if they can't be submitted immediately. The size of this queue can be limited
in the configuration file so as to avoid scmpc taking up all your memory. The
queue is saved at another configurable interval so that if scmpc is stopped
unexpectedly for some reason, such as a power failure, you should 'lose' as
few songs as possible.
.PP
The program is also forgiving in terms of the connection to the MPD server. If
it can't connect immediately it will wait for half an hour and then try again.
If it discovers that the server exists but doesn't respond to requests for the
current song it will assume the server is password protected and the correct
password wasn't specified, and it will not attempt to reconnect. The program
doesn't exit in case there is a queue that could be submitted to
Audioscrobbler, but when that is done the program will do very little. Check
the log if the program doesn't appear to be doing anything.
.PP
.B scmpc
is able to pick up and submit songs if crossfading is enabled, and it is able
to ignore internet streams. It will submit songs without an Album specified,
but only if the Title and Artist are both set.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d or --debug
Sets the logging level to debug, which will log everything considered
noteworthy while the program is being developed. Probably unnecessary for
normal use.
.TP
.B -f or --config-file <file>
The location of an alternative configuration file. This overrides the default
search options, but is still overridden by any command line options.
.TP
.B -h or --help
Prints a summary of the available command line options.
.TP
.B -i or --pid-file <file>
The location of the pid file, which essentially stores the process id and makes
sure that only one copy of the daemon is running at once.
.TP
.B -k or --kill
Kills the currently running scmpc
.TP
.B -n or --foreground
Runs the program in the foreground instead of immediately forking. It also
redirects logging output to standard out and doesn't create a pid file.
.TP
.B -q or --quiet
Sets the logging level to none, which disables logging completely.
.TP
.B -v or --version
Prints the name and version of the program along with a brief copyright notice.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.B scmpc
looks for its configuration file first at \fI~/.scmpcrc\fR, then at
\fI~/.scmpc/scmpc.conf\fR and finally at \fI@sysconfdir@/scmpc.conf\fR. If a
config file is specified as a command line option that file will be used
instead.
.PP
If
.B scmpc
doesn't find a file at any of these locations it will silently use the
compiled in defaults. This will mean that no tracks will be submitted to
Audioscrobbler because no username or password will have been specified, but
.B scmpc
will still add any valid songs to the unsubmitted song queue.
.PP
The format of the configuration file is fairly simple - strings must be quoted,
but numbers and identifiers (such as the logging level) should not be. Comments
start with a hash: #. There are also two sections, mpd and audioscrobbler,
which consist of the section name, an opening brace {, the options specific to
that section, and a closing brace. Whitespace outside the configuration names
and options isn't significant.
.PP
.B Global Configuration Options
.RS
.TP
.B log_level
Select the amount of logging you would like scmpc to do. This is a choice of
four identifiers, not a text string, so don't quote it. Valid options are:
error, warning, info and debug.
.TP
.B log_file
The file that scmpc should write the log to. It will be created if necessary.
.TP
.B pid_file
The file in which scmpc will store its process id, in order to check that it is
only run once, and in order to send the daemon signals. This is only created if
scmpc is run as a daemon.
.TP
.B cache_file
The file in which scmpc will save the unsubmitted song queue for use when the
program restarts. It will be read when scmpc starts, and saved when scmpc
exists. The queue is also saved periodically (how often is controlled by the
\fIcache_interval\fR option).
.TP
.B cache_interval
The interval in minutes between saving the unsubmitted queue in case the
program exits unexpectedly.
.TP
.B queue_length
The maximum number of songs to hold in the unsubmitted songs queue at once. You
are unlikely to need to lower this, but it's there in case.
.RE
.PP
.B MPD Section
.RS
.TP
.B host
The hostname or IP address of the server on which MPD is running. Currently
only supports IPv4.
.TP
.B port
The port which MPD is listening on.
.TP
.B timeout
The timeout in seconds before giving up on the MPD server.
.TP
.B password
Set this if you need a password to read information from the MPD server.
.PP
.RE
.B Audioscrobbler Section
.RS
.TP
.B username
Your Audioscrobbler username.
.TP
.B password
Your plaintext Audioscrobbler password.
.TP
.B password_hash
Your md5 hashed Audioscrobbler password. password_hash will be preferred over password if it is set

.SH BUGS
If libcurl was compiled with IPv6 support and Audioscrobbler supports it, it
should work for communicating with Audioscrobbler, but I have no way of
knowing.
.PP
There is no proxy support for communicating with MPD. However, if you use a
proxy to connect to the internet and your \fIhttp_proxy\fR environment variable
is set up correctly, \fBscmpc\fR should use that automatically when connecting
to Audioscrobbler.
.PP
Currently, there is no support for translating scmpc, but that could be added
at some point in the future if there is demand for it.
.PP
Please report any other bugs to Christoph Mende <angelos@unkreativ.org>.
